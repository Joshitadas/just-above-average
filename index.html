            <h3>AI Agents Explained</h3>
            <hr />
          
            <h4>1. What are AI Agents?</h4>
            <p>
              An AI Agent is a digital worker that can understand natural language instructions and autonomously take actions to complete tasks.
              Think of them as intelligent bots that can mimic how a human might approach a task.
            </p>
            <p>They can perform tasks such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Searching through a database</li>
              <li>Updating spreadsheets</li>
              <li>Sending emails</li>
              <li>Generating documents</li>
              <li>Booking appointments</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h4>2. What is an Agent Made Of?</h4>
            <p>An AI agent typically consists of the following components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>LLM (Large Language Model)</strong> – Acts as the brain of the agent</li>
              <li><strong>Prompt</strong> – Natural language instructions that guide the agent's behavior</li>
              <li><strong>Memory</strong> – Stores short-term or long-term context</li>
              <li><strong>External Knowledge</strong> – Domain-specific information like APIs or documents</li>
              <li><strong>Tools</strong> – Functions or APIs that let the agent take real-world actions</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>With powerful LLMs like GPT-4 taking care of the "brain" and "memory", most of our focus shifts to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Prompts</strong> – Crafting clear and structured instructions</li>
              <li><strong>External Knowledge</strong> – Providing the agent with domain-specific data and context</li>
              <li><strong>Tools</strong> – Giving agents the right APIs or functions to perform real tasks</li>
            </ul>
          
            <hr />
            <h4>3. How Do Agents Work?</h4>
            <p>
              AI agents generally follow a <strong>Plan → Act → Reflect → Plan</strong> loop (PARP loop). Here's a breakdown:
            </p>
            <h5>🧪 Example Prompt:</h5>
            <blockquote>"Send a meeting invite to Alice for Friday at 3 PM."</blockquote>
          
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Decide it needs to check the calendar first.</li>
              <li><strong>Act:</strong> Calls <code>check_calendar()</code> and then <code>send_email()</code>.</li>
              <li><strong>Reflect:</strong> Confirms if the email was sent and calendar slot is booked.</li>
              <li><strong>Plan Again:</strong> If any step fails, re-plan or escalate.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h4>4. Understanding Tools</h4>
            <p>
              Tools are how agents interact with the outside world — they are APIs or functions that perform specific actions.
              Each tool typically comes with a schema, which tells the agent how to use it.
            </p>
          
            <h5>🧩 JSON Tool Schema Example</h5>
            <pre><code>{
            "name": "send_email",
            "description": "Sends an email using provided recipient, subject, and message.",
            "parameters": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "recipient": { "type": "string", "description": "Email address of the recipient" },
                "subject": { "type": "string", "description": "Subject of the email" },
                "body": { "type": "string", "description": "Body of the email" }
              },
              "required": ["recipient", "subject", "body"]
            }
          }</code></pre>
          
            <h5>🐍 Python Implementation of the Tool</h5>
            <pre><code>def send_email(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str):
              print(f"Sending email to {recipient}...\nSubject: {subject}\n\n{body}")</code></pre>
          </div>

            <h3>Why Prompts Are the Secret Weapon for AI Agents</h3>
            <hr />
            
            <p>
              When people talk about AI agents, they usually throw around three big pieces:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>LLMs, Memory, Knowledge – You're good here. GPTs are powerful and everywhere.</li>
              <li>Tools/APIs – Important, but you can pick those as you go.</li>
              <li>Prompts – This is the real sauce. And weirdly, the one everyone rushes past.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h4>Most People Get Prompts Totally Wrong</h4>
            <p>
              Some folks think prompts are just asking the AI nicely, they write vague, wishful, emotional prompts like they're casting a spell.
              But abracadabra won't fix the agent.
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h4>You're Not Just "Asking" — You're Programming</h4>
            <p>
              LLMs aren't psychic. They're simple pattern-matching machines. So we don't only have to 'effectively communicate', we have to 'engineer the prompt'
              To get useful, consistent results, your prompt has to be:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>🧱 Structured</li>
              <li>🔍 Specific</li>
              <li>🧠 Context-aware</li>
              <li>🎯 Output-oriented</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />
            <h4>The 6 Things a Great Prompt Should Have</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Context</strong> – What's happening? Who's it for? Why does it matter?</li>
              <li><strong>Clarity</strong> – Be blunt. Treat it like a machine, not a coworker with vibes.</li>
              <li><strong>Constraints</strong> – Word limits, tone, what to exclude.</li>
              <li><strong>Input/Output formats</strong> – Tables, lists, JSON, markdown — shape the answer.</li>
              <li><strong>Examples</strong> – Show it what good looks like. Copy-paste is its love language.</li>
              <li><strong>Role assignment</strong> – "You are a..." sets the stage and changes the tone.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />
            <h4>Why This Matters for AI Agents</h4>
            <p>
              Without solid prompting, your agent will fumble, guess, and produce garbage. Basically it will hallucinate. 
              With solid prompting, it behaves like a sharp, reliable digital intern — ready to summarize, decide, generate, and take action with clarity.
            </p>
